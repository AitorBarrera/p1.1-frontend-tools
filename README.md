    It makes working with Bootstrap framework easier by giving shortcuts to funcionalities of this framework.

   - **Live Server**
    This extension creates a local server that simulates the use of a server so you can test your code.

   - **Prettier**
    It changes the code color and format so it can be more reable and pleasing for our eyes.

   - **Markdown All in One**
    It provides shortcuts and tools to improve the ways to make markdown files.

### Create a Hello World in JS

7. **Create an `index.html` file inside your worspace folder.**
    
    Done.

    ![extesions-installed](img/create-index.png)

8. **Create the basic html structure using the `!` snippet and change the title to 'Hello World'**

    ````html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>Hello World</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      
    </body>
    </html>
    ````

    Created with the `!` snippet:

    ![html-snippet](img/image.png)
    ![hello-world](img/hello-world.png)

9.  **Create a new file called `app.js` and add this two lines**

    ```javascript
    console.log("Hello Console!")
    document.body.innerHTML = "<h1>Hello document!<h1>"
    ```

    Just created:

    ![js-created](img/js-created.png)

10. **Import the script in your html using one of the techniques explained in class. Explain here the technique, show the code and justify why did you choose this technique**.

    ![linking-js](img/linking-js.png)

    I used the external technique that means i used a link to refer to the script in another file.

    I placed the script tag at the end so it will be load after the rest of the page has been already loaded.

    I prefer this because i think it is cleaner to see the code in differents files even if in this case the code is just two lines. 

11. **Launch `index.html` in Live Server and check that the script is running. Click right button and select inspect to show the developer tools and take a look on the console.**

    It is working!
    ![script-running](img/script-running.png)

12. **Change some message in the JS code and sava changes. You can check that Live Server refreshes the web page.**

    Test:

    ![test-js](img/prueba-js.png)

    It works.

### Create a simple form with Bootstrap 5. 

13. **At this point, we are going to create a page called `form.html` starting from the `Bs5-$` template provided by the Bootstrap extension we added. What files does this template import in the html by default?**

    It imports:
    1. **Bootstrap css in the header:**

    3. **Bootstrap javascript in the body:**
    
        ![importedBootstratJs](img/importedBootstratJs.png)

14. **Create a `<div>`with the class `.container` to wrap all the sections in the web page**

    Here:

    ![container](img/container.png)

15. **Add a standard navigation bar inside the nav area using the `bs5-navbar-default` snippet inside the container**

    Done:

    ![navbar](img/navbar.png)

    Result:

    ![navbar2](img/navbar2.png)


16. **Inside the main area create a form using Bootstrap to collect data from a new user who wants to register at an academy that offers courses. We can copy code from [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/forms/overview/)**. 

    HTML:
